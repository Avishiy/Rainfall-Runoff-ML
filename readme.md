## Overview

HydroAnalytics is an advanced web-based application for hydrological modeling that leverages machine learning techniques to analyze rainfall-runoff relationships. This tool helps hydrologists, environmental scientists, and water resource engineers to predict runoff from rainfall data with high accuracy using state-of-the-art deep learning models.

## Features

- **Multiple Advanced ML Models**: Choose from LSTM with Attention, GRU with Attention, Transformer, and PCA-Based LSTM models.
- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Comprehensive visual analysis with multiple plot types including line, scatter, bar, and residuals.
- **Simple Data Import**: Upload your time-series data via CSV format.
- **Performance Metrics**: Get detailed model performance metrics including MSE, MAE, and RÂ² Score.
- **Report Generation**: Generate and download analysis reports for documentation and presentation.
